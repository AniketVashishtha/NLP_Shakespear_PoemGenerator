# NLP_Shakespear_PoemGenerator
In this project we take sonnets of Shakespeare in order to train our model to generate a Shakesperean poem. By inputting a seed sentence in our model and giving the number of words we want the model to predict on the basis of the seed text we can generate a whole new poem. I used this algorithm to print out lyrics of a song by training the model with that same artist's old songs and the new lyrics that were generated were extremely amusing. Text generation is an extemely interesting application of NLP. N-gram sequences were used in order to make the algorithm understand the context of words in the sentence. You can train this algorithm with any poet's or writer's previous work and can see what words are predicted.
